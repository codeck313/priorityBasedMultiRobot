# priorityBasedMultiRobot
In this paper we describe an algorithm for planning for multiple robots with multiple goal points. We use the D* Algorithm as a backbone to create a priority based planner, further we define four scenes to evaluate the performance of the algorithm and compare the time taken for each scene. We also propose an architecture for directing multiple robots in a centralized manner using Robot Operating System (ROS). The evaluation of both the algorithm and control architecture is done using a simulation in the Gazebo environment.
